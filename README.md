## mushroom_edibility_classification

In this project, I use the k-nearest neighbors algorithm to classify samples of
mushrooms as either edible or poisonous. The motivation behind this project is
to showcase my ability to use machine learning techniques.

The dataset for training and testing was found on
[UC Irvine's Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php).
This dataset includes descriptions of hypothetical samples corresponding to 23
species of gilled mushrooms in the Agaricus and Lepiota families. Each species is
identified as definitely edible, definitely poisonous, or of unknown edibility
and not recommended. This latter class was combined with the poisonous one. You
can download the data set and access its documentation [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/mushroom).

Note: throughout the project, I write with plural subject pronouns as opposed
to singular subject pronouns (e.g. "We have" vs. "I have"). Please do not
make the mistake of assuming a team of people were behind this project. I
worked on this project alone. I simply prefer this writing style for data
science projects as it feels more inclusive -- as if you and I are walking
through the project together :)
